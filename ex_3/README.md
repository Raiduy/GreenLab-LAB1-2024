# The RunTableModel

**The RunTableModel** defines an experiment's measurements with *Factors*, their *Treatment* levels, *exclude certain combinations* of Treatments, number of *repetitions* and add *data columns* for storing aggregated data.

Example:
```python
factor1 = FactorModel("example_factor1", ['example_treatment1', 'example_treatment2'])
factor2 = FactorModel("example_factor2", [True, False])
self.run_table_model = RunTableModel(
    factors=[factor1, factor2],
    exclude_variations=[
        {factor1: ['example_treatment1']}, # all runs having treatment "example_treatment1" will be EXCLUDED
        {factor1: ['example_treatment2'], factor2: [True]}, # all runs having the combination ("example_treatment2", True) will be EXCLUDED
    ],
    repetitions = 3, # how many times each combination should be repeated (default = 1)
    data_columns=['avg_cpu', 'avg_mem'] # columns for the populate_run_data() function
)
```

## Exercise
Using the RunTableModel in Experiment-Runner and EnergiBridge, compare the power consumption, CPU usage and Memory Usage between programs generated by ChatGPT and CodeLlama.
You can find the code in the `code` directory.

From the experiment-runner directory, use `python ./experiment-runner config-create <directory>` to create the *RunnerConfig.py* template.

**Note: This is just an exercise, you do NOT need 30 repetitions per coding problem. 3 is more than enough.**

## Bonus Ex
Exclude problem 61.py as a factor using `exclude_variations`.
