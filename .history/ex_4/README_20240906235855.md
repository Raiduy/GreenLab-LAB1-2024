# Using Hooks in Experiment-Runner
Hooks in `experiment-runner` are specific methods within the `RunnerConfig` class. They allow you to execute actions at various points during the lifecycle of an experiment. These hooks can be used to prepare data, initiate measurements, handle results, or clean up resources.

# Hooks and Their Descriptions
 - before_experiment(): this hook is called once before the entire experiment starts. It is generally used to perform any initial setup required for the experiment.
 - before_run(): this hook is invoked before each individual run within an experiment. 
 - start_run(): it is called at the very start of each run, this hook is used to initiate any activities that should occur at the beginning of the run.
 - start_measurement(): it si triggered when the measurement phase of each run starts.
 - interact(): it is used to interact with the running target system. This hook is where you can define how your system interacts with the experimental environmen

Here are the key hooks you will be working with in the following two exercises:

before_experiment(): This hook is called once before the experiment starts.
after_experiment(): This hook is called once after the experiment ends.

## Exercise 
Add Git committing commands in the before_experiment() hook. This will ensure all changes are backed up to the Git repository before the experiment begins.

### Steps:
 - Open RunnerConfig.py

 - Find the before_experiment() function
 
 - Add Git Commit Commands
    hint: Try subprocess library



## Bonus Ex
Move the result file 

### Steps:
 - Open RunnerConfig.py

 - Find the after_experiment() function

 - Add few lines to move the result file to the targeted path
