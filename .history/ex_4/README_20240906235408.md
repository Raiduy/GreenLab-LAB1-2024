# Using Hooks in Experiment-Runner
Hooks are special functions that allow you to define custom actions at specific points during the experiment lifecycle. In Experiment-Runner, hooks are defined in the RunnerConfig class, and you can use them to perform actions such as preparing data, starting measurements, or handling the results.

Here are the key hooks you will be working with in the following two exercises:
before_experiment(): This hook is called once before the experiment starts.
after_experiment(): This hook is called once after the experiment ends.

## Exercise 
Add Git committing commands in the before_experiment() hook. This will ensure all changes are backed up to the Git repository before the experiment begins.

### Steps:
 - Open RunnerConfig.py

 - Find the before_experiment() function
 
 - Add Git Commit Commands
    hint: Try subprocess library



## Bonus Ex
Move the result file 

### Steps:
 - Open RunnerConfig.py

 - Find the after_experiment() function

 - Add few lines to move the result file to the targeted path
