# `EnergiBridge`

This exercises will make you comfortable using `EnergiBridge` to measure energy consumption (among other things)
of your software. 

## Setup 
See `ex_0` (or the [project repo](https://github.com/tdurieux/EnergiBridge)) for the `EnergiBridge` setup instructions.

## Exercise 1 - output
Understand the output of `EnergiBridge` (i.e. what each of the columns represent). Most of them should be straightforward while some others may require a quick google search. 

## Exercise 2 - options / flags
Play around with the available options. Some ideas are:
- Measure the **total CPU** energy consumed by an infitine loop during 10 seconds. 
- Measure the **total memory** used by an infitine loop during 10 seconds. 
- Measure the **total GPU** memory used by a program of your choice during 10 seconds.
